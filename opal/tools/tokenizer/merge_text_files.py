This script recursively searches a directory for .txt files and merges them into
a single output file while removing duplicate lines. The resulting file is ideal
for training SentencePiece tokenizers as it ensures each unique sentence is
represented exactly once.

The script handles UTF-8 encoded text files and includes error handling to skip
problematic files while continuing with the rest of the processing.

Example usage:
    # Merge all .txt files in the current directory
    python3 merge_text_files.py .

    # Merge files with a custom output filename
    python3 merge_text_files.py /path/to/texts --output=merged_corpus.txt
